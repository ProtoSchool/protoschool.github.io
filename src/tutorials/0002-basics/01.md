    title: "Create a DAG node and return a Content Identifier (CID)"
    type: "code"

In this tutorial we'll be exploring the [IPFS DAG API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/DAG.md), which lets us store data
objects in IPFS. (You can store more exciting things in IPFS, like your favorite
cat GIF, but you'd need to use a different API for that.)

You can create a new DAG node by passing a data object into the [`ipfs.dag.put`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/DAG.md#ipfsdagputdagnode-options) method,
which returns a Content Identifier (CID) for the newly created node.

```javascript
ipfs.dag.put({ hello: 'world' })
```

A CID is an address for a block of data in IPFS that is derived from its content. Every
time someone puts the same `{ hello: 'world' }` data into IPFS, they'll get back an
identical CID to the one you got. If they put in `{ hell0: 'w0rld' }` instead, the
CID will be different.

_Note: Throughout our lessons we'll be using a code editor like the one below.
Enter your solution code within the `run` function that's pre-populated for you,
being sure to return the requested value within that function. (You won't need to
update the `return run` line at the end; that's just there to make the code editor work.)_
