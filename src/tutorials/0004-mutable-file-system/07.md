We've learned how to add files to the root directory, but how can we make a new
directory? Again, the process is very similar to what you may have experienced on
the command line on your own computer.

The MFS method [`files.mkdir`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#ipfsfilesmkdirpath-options) creates a new directory at a specified path. For example, to
add a directory `images` to our root directory ( `/` ), we could do this:

```js
await ipfs.files.mkdir('/images')
```

An optional `parents` property, which defaults to `false`, specifies whether any
parent directories in the given path should be created if they don't already exist.
We didn't need that above, because the new `images` directory was a direct child of an existing
directory ( `/` ). However, if we instead wanted to create a new directory
nested under others that don't yet exist, we'd need to explicitly set the value of
`parents` to `true`, like so:

```js
await ipfs.files.mkdir('/my/beautiful/images', { parents: true })
```

*Gotcha!* Although the goal of creating a missing path is similar, notice how we use the `{ parents: true }` option with `files.mkdir` instead of the `{ create: true }` option that was available with `files.write`.
