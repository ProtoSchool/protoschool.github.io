## Section header (optional)

Your content goes here using Markdown formatting! When you're ready for a new paragraph, just add a blank line.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to instructions on using Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)! 

## Another section header (optional)

Headers are optional but can be used to separate topics in longer lessons. Just be careful not to make your lesson too long! 

Notice how we're using level two Markdown headers (##) in the body of the lesson. A level one header (#) will automatically be inserted with your lesson title, so please do not repeat the title within the body of the lesson.
