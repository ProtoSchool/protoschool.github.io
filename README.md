# ProtoSchool

[ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/) is an educational community that teaches decentralized web protocols and tools
through online tutorials and local events.

This repository is for the main ProtoSchool website, hosted at https://proto.school, where you can
explore our self-guided interactive tutorials.

For information on hosting local events, please visit our [organizing repo](https://github.com/protoschool/organizing).

For the project roadmap, objectives, and archived meeting notes, please visit our [roadmap repo](https://github.com/protoschool/roadmap).

## Building tutorials

Whether you have an idea for a new tutorial or are ready to start building one, you've come to the right place!

First, please read our [**Designing Tutorials**](DESIGNING_TUTORIALS.md) guide, which:
- introduces you to ProtoSchool's guiding principles
- explains the process of proposing a new tutorial topic and soliciting community input
- outlines some key elements of effective learning design so that you can create compelling content

Once you've submitted your proposal for feedback (as described in the [Designing Tutorials](DESIGNING_TUTORIALS.md) guide) and are ready to start building, please refer to our [**Developing Tutorials**](DEVELOPING_TUTORIALS.md) guide for detailed instructions on:
- setting up your local repo
- creating the Markdown and Vue.js files needed to compose your lessons
- validating user responses to code challenges or multiple-choice quizzes
- troubleshooting

## Running ProtoSchool locally

Just here to help someone proof a PR? Jump to our detailed [instructions for running the site locally](DEVELOPING_TUTORIALS.md#run-the-server-locally-to-preview-your-work) or follow the condensed steps below:

Clone the repo, install dependencies, check out the appropriate branch, and run the site locally:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io.git
$ cd protoschool.github.io
$ git checkout existing-branch-name-from-PR
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

View the site on localhost at: http://localhost:3000

## Testing without affecting site analytics in Countly

Only actions taken at the https://proto.school domain affect our main ProtoSchool analytics in Countly.

You can safely experiment with any of the following to send stats to our TEST ProtoSchool dashboard in Countly instead:
- served locally: http://localhost:3000
- live site accessed directly through Fleek: https://protoschool.on.fleek.co/
- preview for a specific PR via link found in PR testing section (e.g. https://bafybeihebd2p64xghtqjuewonkfm4l5n2lkvrllviz7nb33qtyir5q5fau.on.fleek.co/)

## Testing suites

We use Cypress and Jest for testing. Please check the documentation [here](scripts/README.md) for further details.

## Managing remote data

Some data, such as the events list, is pulled at build-time from remote sources using Node.js scripts. Please check the documentation [here](scripts/README.md) for further details.
