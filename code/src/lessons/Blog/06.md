You want to create an overview page that lists your blog posts chronologically.

You *could* do it the same way as we did with tags. However, you would need to update that page (create a new node) every time you added a new blog post. It sounds wasteful to create new nodes with only small changes.

There’s a better way! Whenever you create a new blog post, you can link to the previous one directly. You can walk those links to create the overview page dynamically (which we’ll do in the next exercise).

We know the CID of a blog post as soon as it is stored in IPFS. We can use that CID to link from newer blog posts to older ones.
